Software and Computer Security Final Project

This project is contributed by group 10.
This is a simple application that conists of three separate files, the mobile application called umbra pay in addition to the OTP which serves as the front end and allows the user enter personal informations and the backend is where the database and RSA encryption algorithm is stored.

Scrrenshots of the interface and database is also included in the screenshot section

Here we have used Visual studio and Android studio IDE but you can use any IDE of your choice to run the database and the RSA encyption, but for functioning purpose the use of Android studio would be suitable for the mobile application.

Extract files and you are good to go, there is no additional setup required, but use regular phone number for the OTP.
